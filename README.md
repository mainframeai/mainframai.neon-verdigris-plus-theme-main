# Neon Verdigris Theme

A minimal dark nearly monochrome theme with green highlights for Visual Studio
Code.

## hacked en extended to match my personal preferences.

I love this theme dearly, but was missing a little bit stuff in it. So I added. I hope more or less in the spirit of https://github.com/erbridge
